> I am James Lai, a DevOps engineer. This site collects short project write-ups, troubleshooting notes, and practical guides.

## What I do

 - Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and other automation tools.
 - Build and operate container platforms and Kubernetes-based environments.
 - Automate infrastructure provisioning with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) and configuration management.
 - Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/OpenSearch) to maintain visibility and reliability.

<!-- ## Selected projects

 - **CI/CD Boilerplate** — reusable GitHub Actions workflows and deployment patterns for infrastructure and apps.
 - **Infra as Code Templates** — opinionated Terraform modules for multi-environment deployments.
 - **Observability Stack** — dashboards and alerting rules tuned for production readiness. -->
