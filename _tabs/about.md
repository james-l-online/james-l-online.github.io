# About — James Lai

> I am James Lai, a DevOps engineer building reliable infrastructure, automations, and tooling that help teams ship software faster and safer. This site collects short project write-ups, troubleshooting notes, and practical guides.

## What I do

 - Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and other automation tools.
 - Build and operate container platforms and Kubernetes-based environments.
 - Automate infrastructure provisioning with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) and configuration management.
 - Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/OpenSearch) to maintain visibility and reliability.

## Selected projects

 - **CI/CD Boilerplate** — reusable GitHub Actions workflows and deployment patterns for infrastructure and apps.
 - **Infra as Code Templates** — opinionated Terraform modules for multi-environment deployments.
 - **Observability Stack** — dashboards and alerting rules tuned for production readiness.

Visit the `projects` category for detailed write-ups and deployment notes.

## How I work

 - Prefer small, incremental changes with automated tests and safe rollbacks.
 - Value reproducibility: if it isn't documented and repeatable, it isn't production-ready.
 - Automate repetitive tasks so teams can focus on higher-value work.

## A few technologies I use

 Docker · Kubernetes · Terraform · GitHub Actions · Prometheus · Grafana · Linux · Go · Python · Bash
