Welcome — you're on my DevOps playground.

This site collects my projects, notes, and miscellaneous technical ramblings about infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, observability, containers, and the tools I use every day. Expect short project write-ups, troubleshooting notes, architecture sketches, and occasional opinion pieces.

What you'll find here

- Project pages with code snippets, diagrams, and deployment notes.
- How‑to posts (practical steps and commands I used to solve real problems).
- Tool comparisons and evaluations (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, etc.).
- Experimental and exploratory notes (ideas I may return to later).

<!-- How posts are organized

- I use categories for broad sections (e.g., `about`, `projects`, `tutorials`).
- Tags are used for fine-grained topics (e.g., `devops`, `ci`, `kubernetes`).
- Posts are written as Jekyll posts in the `_posts/` folder with a YAML front matter header. The site theme compiles these into the site navigation and archives.

Contact and contributions

If you see something useful or incorrect, open an issue or a PR on the repository. Links to my social pages are in the sidebar. If you prefer email, use the address shown in the site footer. -->

<!-- Template for new posts (use this exact front matter)

```yaml

title: "A short, descriptive title"
date: 2025-10-01 09:00:00 +0800
categories: [category-name]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

Notes on formatting

- Use sensible, lowercase-dashed filenames for posts when appropriate (Jekyll standard uses `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` but this project accepts `Welcome.md` for single pages).
- Keep front matter fields present and accurate: `title`, `date`, `categories`, and `tags`.
- Write content in Markdown. Use fenced code blocks for commands and snippets. -->

Thanks for stopping by — I'll keep this space updated as I build, learn, and break things.
